# INTRODUCTION TO ROS

This repository presents a friendly introduction to ROS and the usage of the main *[ROS Graph Concepts](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Concepts)* like nodes, topics, services, pusblishers and subscribers; based on the classic [turtlesim package](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim). We also present the basics of ROS connection with the [MATLAB ROS Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ros/ug/get-started-with-ros.html) as an alternative to connect and use all the ROS features.
